I have completed 1 year working out at home consistently.

**Disclaimer**: this post is related to my process and I'm trying to motivate you to be high on endorphin, try to figure out what kind of work out/sport works for you.

I had to start working out because I was sedentary before the pandemic started (2020, March) and I was sick when I returned from an exchange. After eating something fatty I got sick, experiencing headache and nausea. So, I decided to investigate these problems and I went to 3 or 4 doctors and nutritionists. I had to do a lot of exams. The conclusion was: I had to do physical exercises and change my diet.

Letâ€™s focus on the work out process here. I decided to work out at home due to COVID and quarantine. It was not easy to start and stick to this routine. At the beginning, I started to do it 4 times a week and anaerobic on weekends, with time I was adapting my training with my availability. There was a period that I did it 3 times a week on alternate days and I noticed that during the days I didn't workout I was lazier and less willing, so I decided to work out every day in less time.

I can realize the work out routine helps me sleep better, dealing with the anxiety and self-esteem, I feel more willing and that I have some muscles that I couldn't imagine! ðŸ˜„

Not everyday I'm motivated to work out, but I have to do it. After the work out I feel more energetic âš¡. I like to be high on endorphin ðŸ˜‚ there is a Brazilian hashtag #ChapadinhaDeEndorfina and a profile with the same name on Instagram.

Iâ€™m not even close to being an athlete, but it changed my life completely. I would like to do many different sports, like crossfit, boxing, running (Iâ€™m trying this one occasionally), cycling (when I was in Brazil I usually used to cycle once a week), soccer and handball (I used to play when I was at school lol).

Ah, it's an important point here, I'm followed up by a physical education professional. This is a good option to not be hurt while working out.

Iâ€™ll try to write more in English just to practice, feel free to send me a message if you would like to talk more about it with me or anything related :)


Thank you for reading <3
